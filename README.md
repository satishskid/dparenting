### Firebase Security Rules Example
```javascript
// Firestore rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /schools/{schoolId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /partner-branding/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == 'admin@skids.health';
    }
  }
}
