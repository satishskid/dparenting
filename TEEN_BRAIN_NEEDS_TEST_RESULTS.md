# Teen Brain Needs Test Results
*Date: August 4, 2025*

## ‚úÖ TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### **Issue Identified & Fixed**
- **Problem**: The `expandNeed()` JavaScript function was using `display: block` CSS properties instead of the proper CSS class-based animations
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between JavaScript display logic and CSS class-based styling system
- **Fix Applied**: Updated function to use `classList.add('active')` and `classList.remove('active')` methods

### **Current Implementation Status**

#### **Enhanced Content ‚úÖ**
- **Real Examples**: Each brain need now includes 6 concrete, relatable examples
- **SKIDS Insights**: Professional insights explaining the developmental purpose behind teen behaviors
- **Visual Design**: Modern card-based layout with smooth animations
- **Interactive Elements**: Click-to-expand functionality with proper state management

#### **JavaScript Functionality ‚úÖ**
```javascript
function expandNeed(needId) {
  const details = document.getElementById(`${needId}-details`);
  const card = document.querySelector(`.need-card.${needId}`);
  
  if (details && card) {
    const isExpanded = details.classList.contains('active');
    
    // Close all other need details
    document.querySelectorAll('.need-details').forEach(detail => {
      detail.classList.remove('active');
    });
    document.querySelectorAll('.need-card').forEach(c => {
      c.classList.remove('expanded');
    });
    
    if (!isExpanded) {
      details.classList.add('active');
      card.classList.add('expanded');
    }
  }
}
```

#### **CSS Animations ‚úÖ**
```css
.need-details.active {
  max-height: 800px;
